            <header>Introduction</header>
            <p>The Flexible Box Module, usually referred to as flexbox, was designed as a one-dimensional layout model,
                and as a method that could offer space distribution between items in an interface and powerful alignment
                capabilities.</p>
            <p>The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items’
                width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display
                devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them
                to prevent overflow.</p>
            <p>Most importantly, the flexbox layout is direction-agnostic as opposed to the regular layouts (block which
                is vertically-based and inline which is horizontally-based). While those work well for pages, they lack
                flexibility (no pun intended) to support large or complex applications (especially when it comes to
                orientation changing, resizing, stretching, shrinking, etc.) </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="the_two_axes_of_flexbox">
            <header>The two axes of flexbox</header>
            <p>When working with flexbox you need to think in terms of two axes — the main axis and the cross axis. The
                main axis is defined by the <code>flex-direction</code> property, and the cross axis runs perpendicular
                to it. Everything we do with flexbox refers back to these axes, so it is worth understanding how they
                work from the outset.</p>
            <h3>The main axis</h3>
            <p>The main axis is defined by <code>flex-direction</code> , which has four possible values:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>row</code></li>
                <li><code>row-reverse</code></li>
                <li><code>column</code></li>
                <li><code>column-reverse</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Should you choose <code>row</code> or <code>row-reverse</code>, your main axis will run along the row in
                the <b>inline direction</b>.</p>
            <img src="https://media.prod.mdn.mozit.cloud/attachments/2017/11/02/15614/28c51e9af9a679c112cace1dea8eec71/Basics1.png"
                alt=" Main axis - flex-direction: row" class="doc-img">
            <p>Choose <code>column</code> or <code>column-reverse</code> and your main axis will run from the top of the
                page to the bottom - in the <b>block direction</b>.</p>
            <img src="https://media.prod.mdn.mozit.cloud/attachments/2017/11/02/15615/5789d84db9e271d5947fc20fa1980227/Basics2.png"
                alt="Main axis - flex-direction: column" class="doc-img">
            <h3>The cross axis</h3>
            <p>The cross axis runs perpendicular to the main axis, therefore if your <code>flex-direction</code> (main
                axis) is set to <code>row</code> or <code>row-reverse</code> the cross axis runs down the columns.
            </p>
            <img src="https://media.prod.mdn.mozit.cloud/attachments/2017/11/02/15616/48a1d67a5d86fe82221bf2076db98ccb/Basics3.png"
                alt="Cross axis - flex-direction: row" class="doc-img">
            <p>If your main axis is <code>column</code> or <code>column-reverse</code> then the cross axis runs along
                the rows.</p>
            <img src="https://media.prod.mdn.mozit.cloud/attachments/2017/11/02/15617/db2fb92dd4515abfcb6e1153710a00bd/Basics4.png"
                alt="Cross axis - flex-direction: column" class="doc-img">
            <p>understanding which axis is which is important when we start to look at aligning and justifying flex
                items; flexbox features properties that align and justify content along one axis or the other.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="start_and_end_lines">
            <header>Start and end lines</header>
            <p>Another vital area of understanding is how flexbox makes no assumption about the writing mode of the
                document. In the past, CSS was heavily weighted towards horizontal and left-to-right writing modes.
                Modern layout methods encompass the range of writing modes and so we no longer assume that a line of
                text will start at the top left of a document and run towards the right hand side, with new lines
                appearing one under the other.</p>
            <p>If the <code>flex-direction</code> is <code>row</code> and I am working in English, then the start edge
                of the main axis will be on the left, the end edge on the right.</p>
            <img src="https://media.prod.mdn.mozit.cloud/attachments/2017/11/02/15618/02f991ba743910ebd8194840592d3d47/Basics5.png"
                alt="Start and end line in English" class="doc-img">
            <p>If I were to work in Arabic, then the start edge of my main axis would be on the right and the end edge
                on the left.</p>
            <img src="https://media.prod.mdn.mozit.cloud/attachments/2017/11/02/15619/c14b91f60867f1a674719bde15e2fff5/Basics6.png"
                alt="Start and end lines in Arabic" class="doc-img">
            <p>In both cases the start edge of the cross axis is at the top of the flex container and the end edge at
                the bottom, as both languages have a horizontal writing mode.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="the_flex_container">
            <header>The flex container</header>
            <p>An area of a document laid out using flexbox is called <b>flex container.</b> To create a flex container,
                we set the value of the area's container's <code>display</code> property to <code>flex</code> or
                <code>inline-flex</code>. As soon as we do this the direct children of that container become flex items.
                As with all properties in CSS, some initial values are defined, so when creating a flex container all of
                the contained flex items will behave in the following way.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Items display in row. </li>
                <li>The items start from the start edge of the main axis.</li>
                <li>The items do not stretch on the main dimension, but can shrink.</li>
                <li>The items will stretch to fill the size of the cross axis.</li>
                <li>The <code>flex-basic</code> property is set to <code>auto</code>.</li>
                <li>The <code>flex-wrap</code> property is set to <code>nowrap</code>.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Changing flex-direction</h3>
            <p>Adding the <code>flex-direction</code> property to the flex container allows us to change the direction
                in which our flex items display. Setting <code>flex-direction: row-reverse</code> will keep the items
                displaying along the row, however the start and end lines are switched.</p>
            <p>If we change <code>flex-direction</code> to <code>column</code> the main axis switches and our items now
                display in a column. Set <code>column-reverse</code> and the start and end lines are again switched.</p>
            <p>Look at the following code:</p>
            <code>
.box{
        display:flex;
         flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse;
 }       
                </code>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="multi-line_flex_containers_with_flex-wrap">
            <header>Multi-line flex containers with flex-wrap</header>
            <p>While flexbox is a one dimensional model, it is possible to cause our flex items to wrap onto multiple
                lines. In doing so, you should consider each line as a new flex container. Any space distribution will
                happen across that line, without reference to the lines either side.</p>
            <p>To cause wrapping behaviour add the property <code>flex-wrap</code> with a value of <code>wrap</code>.
                Now, should your items be too large to all display in one line, they will wrap onto another line. The
                live sample below contains items that have been given a width, the total width of the items being too
                wide for the flex container. As <code>flex-wrap</code> is set to <code>wrap</code>, the items wrap. Set
                it to <code>nowrap</code>, which is also the initial value, and they will instead shrink to fit the
                container because they are using initial flexbox values that allows items to shrink. Using
                <code>nowrap</code> would cause an overflow if the items were not able to shrink, or could not shrink
                small enough to fit.</p>
            <code>
.box{
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap;
}      
                </code>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="the_flex-flow_shorthand">
            <header>The flex-flow shorthand</header>
            <p>You can combine the two properties <code>flex-direction</code> and <code>flex-wrap</code> into the
                <code>flex-flow</code> shorthand. The first value specified is <code>flex-direction</code> and the
                second value is <code>flex-wrap</code>.</p>
            <code>
.box{
    display: flex;
    flex-flow: row wrap;
 }   
            </code>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="properties_applied_to_flex_items">
            <header>Properties applied to flex items</header>
            <p>To have more control over flex items we can target them directly. We do this by way of three properties:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>flex-grow</code></li>
                <li><code>flex-shrink</code></li>
                <li><code>flex-basic</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Before we can make sense of these properties we need to consider the concept of <b>available space</b>.
                What we are doing when we change the value of these flex properties is to change the way that available
                space is distributed amongst our items. This concept of available space is also important when we come
                to look at aligning items.</p>
            <p>If we have three 100 pixel-wide items in a container which is 500 pixels wide, then the space we need to
                lay out our items is 300 pixels. This leaves 200 pixels of available space. If we don’t change the
                initial values then flexbox will put that space after the last item.</p>
            <img src="https://media.prod.mdn.mozit.cloud/attachments/2017/11/02/15620/e606ba10fa6b8dd7913e5a41ea4602c3/Basics7.png"
                alt="" class="doc-img">
            <p>If we instead would like the items to grow and fill the space, then we need to have a method of
                distributing the leftover space between the items. This is what the flex properties that we apply to the
                items themselves, will do.</p>
            <h3>The flex-basic property</h3>
            <p>The <code>flex-basic</code> is what defines the size of that item in terms of the space it leaves as
                available space. The initial value of this property is <code>auto</code> - in this case the browser
                looks to see if the items have a size. In the example above, all of the items have a width of 100 pixels
                and so this is used as the <code> flex-basis</code>.</p>
            <h3>The flex-grow property</h3>
            <p>With the <code>flex-grow</code> property set to a positive integer, flex items can grow along the main
                axis from their <code>flex-basic</code>. This will cause the item to stretch and take up any available
                space on that axis, or a proportion of the available space if other items are allowed to grow too.</p>
            <p>If we gave all of our items in the example above a <code>flex-grow</code> value of 1 then the available
                space in the flex container would be equally shared between our items and they would stretch to fill the
                container on the main axis.</p>
            <p>The flex-grow property can be used to distribute space in proportion. If we give our first item a
                <code>flex-grow</code> value of 2 and the other items a value of 1, 2 parts will be given to the first
                item (100px out of 200px in the case of the example above), 1 part each the other two (50px each out of
                the 200px total).</p>
            <h3>The flex-shrink property</h3>
            <p>Where the <code>flex-grow</code> property deals with adding space in the main axis, the
                <code>flex-shink</code> property controls how it is taken away. If we do not have enough space in the
                container to lay out our items and <code>flex-shrink</code> is set to a positive integer the item can
                become smaller than the <code>flex-basic</code>. As with <code>flex-grow</code> different values can be
                assigned in order to cause one item to shrink faster than others — an item with a higher value set for
                <code>flex-shrink</code> will shrink faster than its siblings that have lower values.</p>
            <h3>Shorthand values for the flex properties</h3>
            <p>You will very rarely see the <code>flex-grow</code>, <code>flex-shrink</code>, and
                <code>flex-basic</code> properties used individually; instead they are combined into the
                <code>flex</code> shorthand. The <code>flex</code> shorthand allows you to set the three values in this
                order - <code>flex-grow</code>, <code>flex-shrink</code>, <code>flex-basic</code>.</p>
            <p>There are also some predefined shorthand values which cover most of the use cases. You will often see
                these used in tutorials, and in many cases these are all you will need to use. The predefined values are
                as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>flex: initial</code></li>
                <li><code>flex: auto</code></li>
                <li><code>flex: none</code></li>
                <li><code>flex: &lt;positive-number&gt;</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Setting <code>flex: initial</code> resets the item to the initial values of Flexbox. This is the same as
                <code>flex: 0 1 auto</code>. In this case the value of <code>flex-grow</code> is 0, so items will not
                grow larger than their <code>flex-basic</code> size. The value of <code>flex-shink</code> is 1, so items
                can shrink if they need to rather than overflowing. The value of <code>flex-basic</code> is
                <code>auto</code>. Items will either use any size set on the item in the main dimension, or they will
                get their size from the content size.</p>
            <p>Using <code>flex: auto</code> is the same as using <code>flex: 1 1 auto;</code> everything is as with
                <code>flex: initial</code> but in this case the items can grow and fill the container as well as shrink
                if required.</p>
            <p>Using <code>flex: none</code> will create fully inflexible flex items. It is as if you wrote
                <code>flex: 0 0 auto</code>. The items cannot grow or shrink but will be laid out using flexbox with a
                <code>flex-basic</code> of <code>auto</code>.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="alignment_justification_and_distribution_of_free_space_between_items">
            <header>Alignment, justification and distribution of free space between items</header>
            <p>A key feature of flexbox is the ability to align and justify items on the main- and cross-axes, and to
                distribute space between flex items.</p>
            <h3>align-items</h3>
            <p>The <code>align-items</code> property will align the items on the cross axis.</p>
            <p>The initial value for this property is <code>strech</code> and this is why flex items stretch to the
                height of the tallest one by default. They are in fact stretching to fill the flex container — the
                tallest item is defining the height of that.</p>
            <p>You could instead set <code>align-items</code>to <code>flex-start</code> in order to make the items line
                up at the start of the flex container, <code>flex-end</code> to align them to the end, or
                <code>center</code> to align them in the centre. Values of this property are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>stretch</code></li>
                <li><code>flex-start</code></li>
                <li><code>flex-end</code></li>
                <li><code>center</code></li>
            </ul>
            <h3>justify-content</h3>
            <p>The <code>justify-content</code> property is used to align the items on the main axis, the direction
                in which <code>flex-direction</code> has set the flow. The initial value is <code>flex-start</code>
                which will line the items up at the start edge of the container, but you could also set the value to
                <code>flex-end</code> to line them up at the end, or <code>center</code> to line them up in the
                center.</p>
            <p>You can also use the value <code>space-between</code> to take all the spare space after the items
                have been laid out, and share it out evenly between the items so there will be an equal amount of
                space between each item. To cause an equal amount of space on the right and left of each item use
                the value <code>space-around</code>. With <code>space-around</code>, items have a half-size space on
                either end. Or, to cause items to have equal space around them use the value
                <code>space-evenly</code>. With <code>space-evenly</code>, items have a fulll-size space on either
                end.</p>
